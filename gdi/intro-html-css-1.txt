annette / liz intro gdi

who am i?
  my name is amanda. i work for dockyard, which is the space that you are in . it is a design and development consultancy that works in ruby on rails  and ember.js.

goals
  get you comfortable with the basics

how we're going to accomplish this
  hands-on exercises

there's a lot to learn!
  HTML
  CSS
  JS
  design layout fundamentals
  typography
  UI
  content strategy
  SEO

for now let's just talk about HTML, CSS and JS
  HTML - semantics, content, data
  CSS - layout, styling
  JS - interaction, dynamism altho some parts are now available in css3

HTML = HTML is a markup language, which means you're annotating (marking up) plain text to give it structure and meaning, similar to the way you would underline or make notes in a book.

show basic html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>My Web Page</title>
      <link rel='stylesheet' href='style.css'>
      <script src='jquery.min.js'></script>
      <script src='application.js'></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <header id='site-header'>
        <h1 class='logo'>My Awesome Website</h1>
        <nav id='main-nav'>
          <ul>
            <li><a href='item1.html'>Item 1</a></li>
            <li><a href='item2.html'>Item 2</a></li>
          </ul>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <div id='site-wrapper'>
        <section id='site-content'>
          <article>
            <h1>Header</h1>
            <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
          </article>
        </section>
      </div>
      <footer id='site-footer'>
        Copyright 2013. All rights reserved.
      </footer>
    </body>
  </html>

look at the code
  tags come in pairs. start tag and end tag. open and close tag.
  html tag = describes the web page and has links to assets, . is not visible content
  body tag = visible page content
  div tag = defines a division (like a container)
  tags that are generic: div, span
  tags that have semantic meaning: head, body, header, nav, section, article, footer, aside

  head = meta info, links to external assets like css and js
  header = logo, nav, search(maybe), etc
  nav = links to other pages or to parts within the page
  section = a group of content
  article = self-contained piece of content
  footer = footer for the section it applies to, doesn't have to mean the bottom of the page, but usually does

  attributes = <element name = "value">
  above anchor link goes to "value"
  look at class and id
  also <img src = "logo.png">

best practices!
  semantics, separate content from design which means don't put styles in your html
  progressive enhancement
  capabilities, not browsers
  responsive design, beyond desktop view

What is web design?
  A list apart says: Web design is the creation of digital environments that facilitate and encourage human activity; reflect or adapt to individual voices and content; and change gracefully over time while always retaining their identity.

  Wikipedia says: Web Design is the skill of creating presentations of content (usually hypertext or hypermedia) that is delivered to an end-user through the World Wide Web, by way of a Web browser or other Web-enabled software like Internet television clients, microblogging clients and RSS readers.

Know your audience. who is going to be using your site? demographics.
Know your content. design for an organic restaurant is going to be different than design for a college sports team
Know your medium. Desktop, tablet, all?

People recognize things on the web now. blue text with an underline = default link. button, @amandac, hi@amanda.com

Where do you look to log in to a site? top right
How do you go back to the home page? click on logo

Things to avoid:
  interior scroll bars. mouse scrolling all of a sudden doesn't scroll where you think
  iframes.
  auto-playing media




WEB 3

style = selector { property : value }
declaration is everything inside the brackets

class names prefixed with a period (.)
id's prefixed with a pound sign (#)

selector combinations. separate multiple by comma.

pseudo classes
  :hover, :visited, :active, :first-child

there are shortcuts
  ex. border: 1px solid red;

the box model!
  top right bottom left

measurements: 0, px, em, %

layout properties: margin, padding, width, height, border, position, float, clear, display, visibility, background, border-radius, box-shadow

understanding floats and positioning: http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/

cascading hierarchy: inline (please don't do this), !important (only use this when necessary), id, class, order of appearance,

what i do:
  start with reset, meyer reset so startint point is the same cross-browser
  set base styles
  set layout styles
  set module styles

centering things
  margin-right: auto
  margin-left: auto

html5 shiv for non-modern browsers

practice making a nav bar

more design:
  differentiation - different parts should look different
  grouping - alike parts should be close together
  hierarchy
